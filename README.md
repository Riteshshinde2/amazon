1) Most orders were delivered in 2012: This indicates that 2012 saw the highest 

volume of orders being fulfilled compared to other years in your dataset. It 

suggests a potential trend or peak in sales during that particular year, which

could be further analyzed to understand the factors contributing to this surge.

the fourth quarter of the year (October to December) contributed significantly

by quarter can provide insights into seasonal fluctuations, consumer behavior,

and marketing strategies tailored to capitalize on peak periods.

3)Cosmetics was the most sold category: This indicates that cosmetics products

were the top-selling category among all the product categories included in your

dashboard. Understanding which product categories perform best can inform inventory

4) Offline sales were 53.97%, while online sales were 47.07%: This shows the distribution

of sales between offline and online channels. It's interesting to note that offline sales 

slightly outweigh online sales in your dataset. Analyzing this distribution can help in

assessing the effectiveness of omnichannel strategies, optimizing resource allocation between

different sales channels, and identifying opportunities for improving online sales performance.
